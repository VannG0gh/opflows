   - Configure your API credentials:
     - Jira email (associated with API token)
     - API token (for direct API authentication)
     - Project key (target project for API operations)
   - Test API connection through the interface

### 2. Project Lead Configuration

#### Jira API Integration

The tool interacts with several Jira API endpoints:

- Issue Creation API

  - Manages issue relationships

- Issue Link API
  - Creates parent-child relationships
  - Manages issue hierarchies
  - Handles subtask associations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Authentication**:
   - Verify API token hasn't expired
   - Ensure API token has correct permissions
   - Check email matches API token owner
   - Confirm Jira domain is correct

2. **API Operation Failures**:
   - Review API response errors in console
   - Verify user has required Jira permissions
   - Check project key accessibility via API
   - Confirm API rate limits haven't been exceeded

3. **Integration Issues**:
   - Validate API endpoint accessibility
   - Check network connectivity to Jira
   - Review API error responses
   - Verify API version compatibility

### Debug Mode
